# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Watched [Derek Banas's](https://www.youtube.com/user/derekbanas "Derek Banas") [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0p0JLFZj2C8 "C# Tutorial") on [C#](https://www.visualstudio.com/ "C# Visual Studio").

**Thoughts:** C# seems pretty easy. It actually seems easier than C++, and it has a very easy-to-use IDE. :+1:
